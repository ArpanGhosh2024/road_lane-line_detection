# road_lane-line_detection
An OpenCV Python project to implement lane line detection on a video as well as an image for a vehicle.
Hello, this is a road lane lines detection project that I have tried to implement using OpenCv(Python). I have actually learnt how to implement it by watching ProgrammingKnowledge's Youtube video on the same.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLTLtUVuuy4). Though I was new to Computer Vision and OpenCV this tutorial really helped me learn the basics of OpenCv (how to read and display videos and images, how to convert colour images to greyscale images etc.) And also get a brief idea about various other concepts in Computer Vision like Canny Edge Detection, Gaussian Blur, obtaining the region of interest,Hough Transforms etc. In my implementation of the project I have tried to include a lot of documentation as comments so that I can recall the concepts when I revisit this project in the future.
